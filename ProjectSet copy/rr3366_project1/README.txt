Minutes.java
I prompted the user to input hours, days and weeks separately as I thought it would be a lot easier for users to do it 
this way rather than all at once.
I choose to return the total minutes as integers because the previous data types would also be in the integer format. 

Average.java
I choose to use double for my input values as I wanted to allow the user flexibility in their inputs
The output of the code is a double so as to offer the correct precision which would be necessary. 

Easter.java
I prompted the user for a year, not including any error checks as i assume they would prompt in the correct format
I inilialised all the following variables as ints because the easter day and momth would also be given as an integer
The variables would also be in int format as the calculatios would not lead to any decimal numbers
I fllowed the mm/dd/yyyy format to have a clear picture of the date on which easter lies.
